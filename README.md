# Heart_Disease_Prediction

From a medical standpoint, this project is advantageous because it is designed to provide online medical advice and guidance to individuals 
suffering from cardiac disorders. The application will be taught and fed information about a variety of various cardiac diseases.
This clever system uses artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to predict the most accurate disease that might be linked to the information provided by a patient.
Users can then seek medical advice from specialists based on the system’s diagnosis.

## Variables of Dataset
Age – in years
Sex - gender
Cp – chest pain type
trestbps – resting blood pressure
Chol – serum cholesterol
Fbs – fasting blood sugar
Restecg – resting electrographic results
Talach – max heart rate achieved
Exang – exercise induced angina
Oldpeak – ST depression induced by exercise relative to test
Slope – slope of peak exercise ST segment
Ca – number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Thal – thallium heart scan
Target – diagnosis of heart disease


## Main Idealogy
Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research
and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting
the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and predictions are made
with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest ,SVM ,Logistic Regression etc.
This is the Jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras’.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification 
problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Algorithms used(Scikit-learn):

1. Logistic Regression 
2. Naive Bayes 
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) 
4. K-Nearest Neighbors 
5. Decision Tree 
6. Random Forest
Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
